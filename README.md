# SwingCalendar

A Weekly/Daily Swing JComponent Calendar View inspired by Google Calendar.

I originally wrote this component as part of a group project for the COM2002 HCI module at The University of Sheffield.
There are countless improvements that can and should be made and I intent to develop this into a more extensible and publicly consumable component should I have the time (feel free to put in some PRs!).

As it stands, the calendar has a Weekly and Daily view and Events that fire on a CalendarEvent being clicked or an empty slot being clicked. These were particularly useful for the application this was originally intended for.
